description: Use when a user wants Clara to map retail product attributes, preserve the existing new-versus-rest or best-seller-versus-other analysis, create a private local HTML report, or answer whether that report is correct.

# Attribute Reporting

Resolve `../../modules/attribute-reporting` from this skill directory when it
exists; otherwise resolve `../../../attribute-reporting` in the repository.
Read that component's `skills/attribute-reporting/SKILL.md` completely and
follow it. Treat the resolved component root as a read-only execution root for
its scripts, requirements, references, and vendored modules. Run component
helpers with that root as the working directory, but create every user run and
artifact outside the resolved component root, every Git repository, and every
plugin cache. Never place run artifacts in the packaged component.

Before running component helper scripts, delegate the dependency check from
the Clara root:

```bash
python scripts/check_dependencies.py --module attribute-reporting
```

Attribute Reporting is a self-contained analytical workflow. Do not register
its report in an advisory case, convert it into a 16:9 presentation, or upload
it to Mparanza unless the user separately asks for that follow-on work. If the
user asks for a presentation after the checked HTML report is complete, hand
the finished report to Clara's `html-deck` workflow as a new, explicit step.

Do not use this workflow for Brand Fit. When the user wants to compare completed
retailer signals with both a brand's current presence at that retailer and the
brand-owned catalogue, route to Clara's distinct `brand-fit` skill.
