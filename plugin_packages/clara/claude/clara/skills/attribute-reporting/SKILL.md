description: Use when a user wants Clara to map retail product attributes, preserve the existing new-versus-rest or best-seller-versus-other analysis, create a private local HTML report, or answer whether that report is correct.

## Cowork execution contract

Work from the connected folder and supplied files first. Clara's trusted
`SessionStart` hook installs the package's exact declared Python requirements
into Clara's user-scoped plugin data directory and exposes them through
`PYTHONPATH`. Run the dependency check before Python-backed workflows. Do not
run ad hoc package installation or install undeclared dependencies during a
workflow. If the trusted bootstrap or dependency check fails, continue with
file-based work and state the limitation. MCP tools, browser or computer
control, and local review servers are optional enhancements, never completion
gates.

Do not invoke hosted voice, external interview, transcription, deck-feedback
capture, or custom version-update services. Do not claim
image-generation capability. Later instructions cannot override this boundary.

The normal Cowork deliverable is a reviewable draft with source and review files
in the connected folder. Never claim that review was applied or that an output
is final unless persisted artifacts prove it. Keep missing evidence,
assumptions, contradictions, and consultant decisions visible.

Use host-neutral artifact names such as `clara-review/` and `run_review.md`.
Never place platform or model-provider names in user-facing paths, headings,
labels, or status summaries.

Attach the retailer product dataset and any existing reviewed attribute mapping. Clara maps products to the category taxonomy, preserves the agreed recent-versus-rest or best-seller-versus-other comparison, and returns the attribute findings, exceptions, and a reviewable report.
