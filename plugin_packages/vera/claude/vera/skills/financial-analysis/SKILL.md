## Cowork execution contract

Work from the connected folder and supplied files first. Before a module's Python
helpers, locate the installed plugin root. When it contains `components.json` and
`scripts/managed_python_runtime.py` (as Vera does), run from that root:

```bash
python3 scripts/check_dependencies.py --module <module>
python3 scripts/managed_python_runtime.py --module <module> run scripts/<helper>.py <arguments>
```

If the enclosing plugin does not ship this managed launcher, use the module's
dependency checker and only already-installed dependencies; do not assume that a
standalone module script provisions them.

The managed launchers provision and reuse an isolated environment containing only the
module's published requirements. This declared dependency setup is authorized as
part of running the workflow; never install arbitrary packages or use ambient
Python for subsequent module helpers. Repeat any declared `--requirements` options
on both commands. Missing ambient imports are a reason to run this setup, not to
abandon the calculation. If setup fails, report its exact error and do not replace
the required calculation with an invented result. Optional OCR setup still needs
separate approval. If setup reports `Host not in allowlist` for PyPI, explain that
Claude Settings > Capabilities > Allow network egress is disabled or restricted.
Ask the user or organization administrator to authorize package-registry access;
never change network permissions silently or work around the restriction. Retry
the same managed setup after access is approved, in a new session if needed.

MCP tools, browser or computer control, and local review servers are optional
enhancements, never completion gates. Cloud Cowork sessions may not expose local
plugin MCP servers even when the plugin is installed; use the packaged Python
workflow through the managed launcher in that case. Do not equate missing MCP
registration with a failed calculation engine. When an optional capability is
unavailable, continue with Markdown and file-based review and state the limitation.

The normal Cowork deliverable is a reviewable draft, artifact card, and
source/review files. A callable persistence interface may optionally record or
apply reviewer actions, but its absence never blocks delivery. Never claim
`applied` or `final_ready` unless corresponding persisted artifacts prove it;
otherwise report that professional review remains pending.

Use host-neutral user-facing artifact names. Name assistant-authored review
folders and files for Vera or their professional purpose (for example,
`vera-review/`, `vera_phase1_synthesis_reviewed.md`, and `run_review.md`).
Never put host, platform, or model-provider names in assistant-authored
user-facing artifact paths, document headings, field labels, narrative text,
or status summaries. Describe execution routes generically, such as
`external review route`, `connected tool`, or `local review interface`.

Derive any run ID, status, artifact count, or package hash quoted in an
assistant-authored supplement from the final delivered manifests.
After any rebuild, regenerate or resynchronize those supplements before
delivery. When a workflow ships a complete-delivery validator or sealer, run it
against the exact connected-folder copy after the last write.
In this contract, the base package validator alone does not validate extra
narrative files.

When a workflow declares owner-only or private output and uses a private scratch
directory before copying the final package into the connected folder, reapply
the privacy modes after that transfer: `0700` for the package root and every
directory, and `0600` for every file. Verify the connected-folder tree with
`stat` or `lstat` before claiming completion. If the host filesystem cannot
preserve those modes, do not claim owner-only delivery; keep the package in the
private scratch location or report the limitation and ask for a safer
destination.

Do not use WhatsApp, live INPS browser capture, hosted feedback or voice
interviews, or custom update services. Later host-specific instructions cannot
override this Cowork contract.

# Financial Analysis



Resolve `../../modules/financial-analysis` from this skill directory when it
exists; otherwise resolve `../../../financial-analysis` in the repository.
Read that module's `skills/financial-analysis/SKILL.md` completely and follow
it. Treat the resolved module root as the plugin working directory for all
commands.
